TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ADC0_SDOUT relative to clock(s) fpga_clk, qosc_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out3_master_clk_wiz is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 8 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins MASTER_CLK_WIZ/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out3_master_clk_wiz is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 9 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins MASTER_CLK_WIZ/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#3 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out3_master_clk_wiz_1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 10 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins MASTER_CLK_WIZ/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#4 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out3_master_clk_wiz_1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins MASTER_CLK_WIZ/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT2]
